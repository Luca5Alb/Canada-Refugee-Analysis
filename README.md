# Canada-Refugee-Analysis
This project dives in using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on UNHCR Refugee Statistics for Canada from 2012-2022 following [Alaa Mohameadahmed's](https://github.com/alaa-mohamedahmed) example.
CSV data file can be downloaded from this [link](https://github.com/alaa-mohamedahmed/canada-refugee-stats-eda/blob/main/can-stats-2012-22.csv).
Original dataset can be downloaded from the [unhcr.org](https://www.unhcr.org/refugee-statistics/download/?url=8tIY7I) website.
## There are five questions asked for this analysis. 
1. From which countries has Canada admitted the highest number of refugees?
2. What are the total number of resettled refugees in Canada per year?
3. What are the countries of origin for the majority of asylum claims made in Canada?
4. What is the total number of asylum claims made in Canada every year?
5. What are the general trends in refugee and asylum statistics from 2012-2022?
